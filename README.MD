# Blackjack in Python ver 1.0

A simple ~walk through mor~ blackjack game

For my first Python project ever (and first programming project ever since starting my self taught route) I decided to make a
game of blackjack!

For this first version it only has the simple mechanics of playing a round and asking you to continue on if you'd like. Later on
I will add more functionality to the game like allowing the player to bet chips and keep going until they wish to stop or until
they bankrupt themselves from losing way too much.

## Requirements

Python 3.8.2

## How to Run

To run the program all you need to do is run the Python file using your OS's terminal setup `Python blackjack.py` or
`Python3 blackjack.py`
